# Household-Power-Consumption-Forecasting-with-XGB-Regressor
### <span style="background-color:orange"> Forecasting energy/electricity demand with XGB Regressor


The goal of this project is to predict and forecast power consumption demand by applying Gradient Boosting. This is a time series data with seasonal patterns. This model aims to learn the seasonal patterns and behaviours from the data and apply that to predict future values to cope with the increasing demand.
